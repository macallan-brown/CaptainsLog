# Captain's Log
An iOS app for better storytelling by cataloging the memorable moments in your life. 

##Why did I build it?
While traveling across the United Kingdom in the summer of 2016, I kept an extremely detailed journal with every place, meal, and conversation that I experienced. I wanted to remember the places I went, but more importantly I wanted to tell my stories.

Captain's Log is a tool to facilitate me in my quest to become a better storyteller. It serves as a reminder of the moments in my life, not the stories themselves. The goal is to quickly capture important details from moments so that the stories themselves are not lost in the abyss of my memory.
